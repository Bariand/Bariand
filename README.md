My name is Lucas Freitas Cordeiro, a Systems Analysis and Development student from Brazil.
I am interest in a diversity of fields, but my focus is on C# and the .NET framework. I also have some knowledge on HTML and CSS and a bit of Javascript. I do some game development as a hobby from time to time, using C# and game engines like Godot and Unity.

I'm working at FOURSYS as an intern at the moment.
