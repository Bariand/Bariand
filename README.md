My name is Lucas Freitas Cordeiro, a System Analysis and Development student from Brazil.
I am interest in a diversity of fields, but my focus is on C# and the .NET framework. I also have some knowledge on HTML and CSS, a bit of Javascript and I play sometimes with game development with Godot and sometimes with Unity.

I'm working at FOURSYS as an intern for the time being.
