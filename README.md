My name is Lucas Freitas Cordeiro, a System Analysis and Development student from Brazil.
I am interest in a diversity of fields, but I'm focusing my studies on C# and the .NET framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript for web development and also a bit of game development with Unity.
I'm at the moment looking for a trainee program or intership. I just want to start working, man...   : )
