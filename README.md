Iâ€™m Lucas 'Bariand' Cordeiro, a System Analysis and Development student from Brazil.
I am interest in a lot of fields, but I'm focusing my studies on C# and .NET Core, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also have interest in game development with Unity.
I'm at the moment looking for an internship with .NET Core for web development or other C# focuses technologies like game development with Unity.

I also happen to be a Biologist with a Master's Degre and a PhD, both in Physiological Sciences, for what it's worth.
